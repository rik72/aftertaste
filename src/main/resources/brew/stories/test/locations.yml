          You find yourself in a cramped and cluttered toolshed.
          Scattered tools and cans of paint vie for space on dusty shelves lining the walls.
          To the east you see a weathered door, and, on the same wall, a grimy window.
        possibilities:
          - impossible: fly ( The ceiling is very low. )

          The toolshed basks in the light coming mainly from the open door on the east.
          Scattered tools and cans of paint vie for space on dusty shelves that line the walls.
          In the east wall a small, grimy window offers a glimpse of the world outside.

          You are in a garden, sprawling in natural splendor â€” a tapestry of vibrant colors and scents.
          Lush foliage dances with the breeze, vibrant blooms nodding in approval.
          To the west you see a weathered wooden toolshed. To the north you see a distant tower.
        directions:
          north: tower ( fly )

          You are on the top of a very high tower.

          Now you remember: last night you drank too much beer and well... maybe letting the water imp drive home
          was not a good idea.

        finale: >
          Your life goes back to business as usual, but every now and then you wonder
          how on earth you ended up in that old cranky little toolshed...
