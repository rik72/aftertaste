          You find yourself in a cramped and cluttered toolshed.
          Scattered tools and cans of paint vie for space on dusty shelves lining the walls.

          The toolshed basks in the light coming mainly from the open door on the east.
          Scattered tools and cans of paint vie for space on dusty shelves that line the walls.
          In the east wall a small, grimy window offers a glimpse of the world outside.
