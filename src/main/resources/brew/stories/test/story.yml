  intro:
    - >
      You find yourself slowly and painfully emerging from a deep slumber, the very air you breathe
      heavy with the weight of forgotten dreams. As consciousness reluctantly reclaims its grip,
      a haze lifts, and the world swims into focus, revealing your own figure in a dimly lit space.

      Slowly, awareness seeps in, a dull ache pervading every limb.
