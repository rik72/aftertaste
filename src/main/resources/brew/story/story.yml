    A test scenario

  intro:
    - >
      You find yourself slowly and painfully emerging from a deep slumber, the very air you breathe
      heavy with the weight of forgotten dreams. As consciousness reluctantly reclaims its grip,
      a haze lifts, and the world swims into focus, revealing your own figure in a dimly lit space.

      Slowly, awareness seeps in, a dull ache pervading every limb.

    - >
      Disheveled and weary, you realize to be seated upon the ground, your body protesting the uncomfortable
      slumber endured for who knows how long. The room, cloaked in shadows, offers little solace or
      familiarity. Dim shapes and vague outlines taunt the memory, hinting at forgotten corners and
      forgotten purposes.

    - >
      You try to shake off the heaviness of an uncertain sleep, and your muscles protest the stiffness
      of prolonged inactivity as you gingerly rise. A distant echo, a haunting whisper of a once
      vibrant past, urges exploration and understanding amidst the haze of confusion.

    - >
      With a cautious resolve, you begin to navigate an unfamiliar terrain of unanswerable questions.

      Where am I? How long has it been?
      
      Your journey to unearth the truth begins,
      in the hope to piece together the fragments of a disrupted existence...
